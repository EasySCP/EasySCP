//  |  The messages to translate are listed below.                                  |
//  |  The structure of each line is like this:                                     |
//  |     $message["Hello world!"] = "Hello world!";                                |
//  |                                                                               |
//  |  Keep the text between square brackets [] as it is.                           |
//  |  Translate the 2nd part, keeping the same punctuation and HTML tags.          |
//  |                                                                               |
//  |  The English message, for example                                             |
//  |     $message["net2ftp is written in PHP!"] = "net2ftp is written in PHP!";    |
//  |  should become after translation:                                             |
//  |     $message["net2ftp is written in PHP!"] = "net2ftp est ecrit en PHP!";     |
//  |     $message["net2ftp is written in PHP!"] = "net2ftp is geschreven in PHP!"; |
//  |                                                                               |
//  |  Note that the variable starts with a dollar sign $, that the value is        |
//  |  enclosed in double quotes " and that the line ends with a semi-colon ;       |
//  |  Be careful when editing this file, do not erase those special characters.    |
//  |                                                                               |
//  |  Some messages also contain one or more variables which start with a percent  |
//  |  sign, for example %1\$s or %2\$s. The English message, for example           |
//  |     $messages[...] = ["The file %1\$s was copied to %2\$s "]                  |
//  |  should becomes after translation:                                            |
//  |     $messages[...] = ["Le fichier %1\$s a été copié vers %2\$s "]             |
//  |                                                                               |
//  |  When a real percent sign % is needed in the text it is entered as %%         |
//  |  otherwise it is interpreted as a variable. So no, it's not a mistake.        |
//  |                                                                               |
//  |  Between the messages to translate there is additional PHP code, for example: |
//  |      if ($net2ftp_globals["state2"] == "rename") {           // <-- PHP code  |
//  |          $net2ftp_messages["Rename file"] = "Rename file";   // <-- message   |
//  |      }                                                       // <-- PHP code  |
//  |  This code is needed to load the messages only when they are actually needed. |
//  |  There is no need to change or delete any of that PHP code; translate only    |
//  |  the message.                                                                 |
//  |                                                                               |
//  |  Thanks in advance to all the translators!                                    |
//  |  David.                                                                       |
//  |                                                                               |
