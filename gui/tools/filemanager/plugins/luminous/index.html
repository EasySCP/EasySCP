    <h1>Luminous - a Syntax Highlighter for PHP - v0.7.0</h1>

<p><a href="http://travis-ci.org/markwatkinson/luminous"><img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/markwatkinson/luminous.png" alt="Build Status" title="" /></a></p>

<p>Luminous is an accurate and style-able syntax highlighter for PHP which 
supports a bunch of common languages and output to HTML and LaTeX.</p>

<p>If you simply want to use Luminous as a library, <strong>please don't clone this 
repository</strong>. Or if you do, make sure you delete luminous/tests afterwards. 
Do not expose luminous/tests on a public machine. It is recommended to get a 
packaged version from the links below.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Extract your tarball, zip, whatever, into some directory where it's going to be
used (i.e. probably your web-server).  We'll assume it's called `luminous/'</p>

<h1>Quick Usage </h1>

<p>First, if you're going to use caching, which you probably are, create a 
directory called luminous/cache and give it writable permissions (chmod 777 on
most servers -- yours may accept a less permissive value). Then include
luminous/luminous.php and away you go!</p>

<p><div 
        class="luminous" 
        data-language="PHP"
        style=""
      ><table><tbody><tr><td><pre class="line-numbers"><span>1</span><span>2</span><span>3</span><span>4</span></pre></td><td class="code-container"><pre class="code numbered"
                data-startline="1"
                data-highlightlines=""
              ><span><span class='delimiter'>&lt;?php</span>
</span><span><span class='function'>require_once</span> <span class='string'>'luminous/luminous.php'</span><span class='operator'>;</span>
</span><span><span class='function'>echo</span> <span class='obj'>luminous</span><span class='operator'>::</span><span class='oo'>head_html</span>()<span class='operator'>;</span> <span class='comment'>// outputs CSS includes, intended to go in &lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span><span class='function'>echo</span> <span class='obj'>luminous</span><span class='operator'>::</span><span class='oo'>highlight</span>(<span class='string'>'c'</span><span class='operator'>,</span> <span class='string'>'printf("hello world<span class='esc'>\n</span>");'</span>)<span class='operator'>;</span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>

<p>Useful examples can be found in luminous/examples/. If you have problems,
check that luminous/examples/example.php works.</p>

<h1>Command Line Usage</h1>

<p>If you're crazy and want to use Luminous/PHP on the command line, guess what,
you can!</p>

<p><div 
        class="luminous" 
        data-language="Bash"
        style=""
      ><table><tbody><tr><td><pre class="line-numbers"><span>1</span><span>2</span></pre></td><td class="code-container"><pre class="code numbered"
                data-startline="1"
                data-highlightlines=""
              ><span>$ <span class='function'>cd</span> luminous/
</span><span>$ php luminous.php --help
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>

<h1>Polite Warning</h1>

<p>Luminous is fairly slow. But it caches! So it's not slow. Or is it?</p>

<p>It depends on your use-case, is the simple answer. Most people should make sure
the cache works (create luminous/cache with appropriate permissions), and after
that, Luminous will almost certainly have negligable impact on their 
performance.</p>

<p>Optimizations are welcome, but not at the expense of maintainability.</p>

<h2>Caching</h2>

<p>The cache can be stored either directly on the file system or in a MySQL table
(support for other DBMSs will come later, patches welcome). In either case,
check out the <a href="http://luminous.asgaard.co.uk/index.php/docs/show/cache">cache documentation</a>.</p>
