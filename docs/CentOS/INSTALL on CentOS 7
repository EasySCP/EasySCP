1) Version info
---------------
EasySCP Version:	2.1.0
INSTALL Script:		1.0.0
Maintainer:			Markus Szywon
Homepage:			http://www.easyscp.net
Linux Distros:		CentOS 7

This documentation was written for CentOS 7. While you might
be able to install on earlier versions, you may encounter difficulties or
differences. In addition, this guide uses the YUM tool to install packages. If
you normally use a different tool, you will need to modify the instructions to
fit your system.
The instructions are based on a minimum installation of CentOS with no optional
packages marked during OS install. If you selected additional options during the
install process, some extra server services may need to be disabled to avoid
interfering with the packages used by EasySCP.
The install instructions attempt to keep system changes to a minimum, so these
instructions should also work under Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. If you encounter
differences, please notify the maintainer.
The installation tasks should be run as root

================================================================================
2) System requirements
---------------
There are no real requirements. The following just resembles an advice:

Pentium III or K6-4 with 500 MHz
512 MB RAM (768 MB and higher recommended)
100 MB Space for the EasySCP Setup data
Minimal CentOS 7 (do not install any additional software on the server as it will conflict with EasySCP)

All required packages for "CentOS 7" are listed in /docs/CentOS/centos-packages-7

================================================================================
3) Introduction
---------------
EasySCP delivers a complete hosting automation appliance by offering significant
security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

With EasySCP you can configure your server and applications, create user with
domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.
There is no limit to the number of resellers, users and domains that can be
created. The core of EasySCP are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. EasySCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

================================================================================
4) Preparation
--------------
For the following steps, you will need to be logged in as root.

1.	Make sure your OS is updated
	The very first thing you should do is make sure your base Linux install is
	fully updated. To do so, simply run "yum update" as root. If there was a
	kernel upgrade, you will want to reboot before continuing.
		# yum update


2.	Additional Software Repositories
	The CentOS repositories do not include all the software needed to run EasySCP.
	You will need to add another repositories to your system to install everything
	you need.

	EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):
		EPEL contains most of the additional packages needed.
		Install this repository following
		http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#howtouse

	Example:
		# rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-8.noarch.rpm


3. Disabling SELinux
	SELinux will need to be disabled if it is enabled. To disable, run

	# setenforce 0

	as root. To ensure that it stays disabled between reboots, edit the file
	/etc/selinux/config and change the value of SELINUX to disabled. 

================================================================================
5) Installation
---------------
Be sure you are logged in as root.

1.	Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
		# cd /usr/local/src
		# tar xjvf easyscp-2.1.0.tar.bz2

2.	Change to the newly created directory:
		# cd ./easyscp-2.1.0

3.	Install the required modules
	A list of packages required by this software is located in
	/docs/CentOS/centos-packages and can be used to easily install the packages
	you need by running the following commands:
		# yum install $(cat ./docs/CentOS/centos-packages-7)

	NOTE: Running this command will install both x86_64 and i3/5/686 packages on
	x86_64 installs for all packages that have both architectures in the
	repository! To avoid, either add "exclude=*.i386 *.i586 *.i686" for your yum
	repository configuration files, or install the packages listed in the file
	one-by-one, making sure to specify the package name in the format
	packagename.x86_64.

4.	Make sure that SQL Server is running for setup:
		# service mariadb start

5.	Start the basic setup:
		# sh easyscp-setup.sh

	Setup will now Build the Software and copy all the directories into your system.
	After that, Setup will then secure your MariaDB installation.
	Change or create MariaDB root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege tables.

	If no error occour go to the web-frontend and install EasySCP step-by-step.

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at http://www.easyscp.net to solve the problem.
